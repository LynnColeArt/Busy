# Busy: AI Agent Collaborative Development Framework

## Overview
Busy is a specialized development framework designed to streamline collaborative software development for AI agents. It provides a structured, intention-driven approach to code creation and project management.

## Purpose
The primary goal of Busy is to create a systematic workflow that allows AI agents to:
- Collaborate effectively across different programming languages
- Maintain clear intent and reasoning in code development
- Standardize project contributions
- Manage complex software development processes

## Key Features
- Domain-specific language (`.op` files) for structured development
- Multi-language support
- Comprehensive workflow management
- Git integration
- Detailed metadata tracking

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.20 or later
- Git
- Basic understanding of `.op` file syntax

## Compilation
