# Go Coding Standards

## Document Structure

This directory contains the Go coding standards for projects focusing on clear, maintainable, and efficient Go code.

### Files:
- `core-standards.md` - Primary rules, philosophy, and requirements
- `implementation-guide.md` - Detailed patterns and implementation guidance
- `/examples` - Concrete code examples demonstrating standards

## Quick Start

1. Read `core-standards.md` first to understand the philosophy and core rules
2. Refer to `implementation-guide.md` for specific patterns and practices
3. Check `/examples` for concrete implementations

## Key Principles

- Explicit over implicit
- Error handling as flow control
- Resource monitoring first
- Composition over inheritance
- Small, focused packages
- No global state

## Contributing

When adding examples or updating standards:
1. Ensure all code follows the core standards
2. Include clear explanations of principles being demonstrated
3. Keep examples focused and minimal
4. Add tests for all example code
5. Run examples with the race detector
