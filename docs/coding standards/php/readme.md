# PHP Coding Standards

## Document Structure

This directory contains the PHP coding standards for projects requiring Pythonic PHP implementation.

### Files:
- `core-standards.md` - Primary rules, philosophy, and requirements
- `implementation-guide.md` - Detailed patterns and implementation guidance
- `/examples` - Concrete code examples demonstrating standards

## Quick Start

1. Read `core-standards.md` first to understand the philosophy and core rules
2. Refer to `implementation-guide.md` for specific patterns and practices
3. Check `/examples` for concrete implementations

## Key Principles

- PHP code should feel and behave like Python where possible
- Strict typing is mandatory
- Simplicity over patterns
- Clear, maintainable code over clever solutions

## Contributing

When adding examples or updating standards:
1. Ensure all code follows the core standards
2. Include clear explanations of principles being demonstrated
3. Keep examples focused and minimal
4. Add tests for all example code
